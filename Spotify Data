--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, created a table to insert the data, and analyzed the data.

--Table created:

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

--Spotify data was inserted as a .csv file.

--Which artists have more than one song in the Top 50? List the artists with the most hits at the top.

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) AS Top50Songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(artist_name)>1 
ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) DESC

--Use track IDs to identify which songs Doja Cat sings.

SELECT track_name AS DojaCatSongs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_id IN(SELECT track_id FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata WHERE artist_name LIKE '%Doja Cat%')

--List the Top 50 songs in order of popularity.

SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > (SELECT AVG(popularity) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata)
ORDER BY popularity DESC
